<h2>How to Recognize and Verify a User-Defined Trigger (Deprecated API)</h2>
<p>
THIS SECTION HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY
<a href="UDTandEFT.html">How to Implement User-Defined Triggers or Enrolled Fixed Triggers (With or
Without Speaker Verification)</a>
</p>
<p>
The recognizer created using <a href="thfUdtEnroll.html">thfUdtEnroll</a>
and saved to file using <a href="thfUdtSaveToFile.html">thfUdtSaveToFile</a>
can be read using a call to
<a href="thfRecogCreateFromFile.html">thfRecogCreateFromFile</a>, and the
search created by <a href="thfUdtEnroll.html">thfUdtEnroll</a>
and saved to file using <a href="thfUdtSaveToFile.html">thfUdtSaveToFile</a>
can be read using a call to
<a href="thfSearchCreateFromFile.html">thfSearchCreateFromFile</a>.  Then, the
application should set the delay using a call to
<a href="thfPhrasespotConfigSet.html">thfPhrasespotConfigSet</a> and initialize
using a call to
<a href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a> before spotting the user defined
triggers.
</p>
<p>
Phrasespotting with a user-defined trigger (UDT) is performed in the same way
as other phrasespotting (see
<a href="process.html">How to Build and Run the Recognizer</a>),
using the UDT recognizer and search created during the UDT enrollment process.
With a single user, the phrasespot delay can be set as short as 15 msec (but
0 msec should not be used).  With multiple users, the phrasespot delay should
be set to at least 250 msec to maintain accuracy.
</p>

<p>
After a call to
<a href="thfRecogResult.html">thfRecogResult</a>
has returned a result indicating which user's trigger phrase was detected,
a subsequent call to
<a href="thfRecogSVscore.html">thfRecogSVscore</a>
will return a speaker-verification score.  Higher scores indicate greater confidence
in the result, and can be compared against a pre-defined threshold to accept
or reject the trigger as spoken by the target user.
These thresholds are set by the application designer, and they can be modified
by the application based on factors such as phrase length, amount of detected
background noise, or characteristics of the speaker who enrolled.  However,
a good starting point is a threshold around 0.60.
