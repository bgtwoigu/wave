<h2>SDK Components</h2>

<p>
The SDK is available for various platforms (e.g., ix86-win,
ix86-linux). Please make sure to refer to the accompanying
<em>TrulyHandsfree SDK\&lt;platform&gt;\Readme.txt</em>
file for platform-specific information.</p>

The SDK distribution includes the following directory structure
relative to the <em>&lt;install&gt</em> directory:

<pre>
+ <b>TrulyHandsfree SDK:</b> contains entire SDK distribution.
  + <b>Data:</b> contains SDK language packs
    + <b>&lt;language&gt;</b> (e.g., en_us_16kHz_v9): contains language-specific
      acoustic models, pronunciation models and documentation.

  + <b>include:</b> contains headers with API definitions.
  + <b>&lt;platform&gt;</b> (e.g., ix86-win): contains platform-specific
    binaries and documentation.
    + <b>bin:</b> contains tools and executable samples.
    + <b>lib:</b> contains static libraries.
    + <b>Samples:</b> contains sample code.
      + <b>Data:</b> contains data files used by the samples.
      + <b>Shared:</b> contains support code used by the samples.

</pre>
We now describe each of these directories and their content.

<h3>Data Files "TrulyHandsfree SDK\Data\&lt;language&gt;": </h3>

<p> All language-specific data is contained in a single folder;
referred to as a <em>language pack</em>. Two types of data files are
provided in the data directory: <em>Acoustic Models</em> and
<em>Pronunciation Models</em>.</p>

<p> The acoustic models are implemented as neural networks, often
referred to as <em>nets</em>. A selection of different size nets are
provided using the following naming conventions:

<pre>
  nn_&lt;language&gt;_&lt;dialect&gt;_&lt;samplerate&gt;_&lt;framesize&gt;_&lt;hidden layer size&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.raw
</pre>
<p> The pronunciation model files use the following naming convention:
<pre>
  lts_&lt;language&gt;_&lt;dialect&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.raw
</pre>
</p>


<p>The folder also contains a <b>Help</b> file that describes the acoustic model characteristics, including the list of phonemes supported and relative performance of the different size acoustic models. </p>

<h3>Include Files "TrulyHandsfree SDK\include":</h3>
<p>The SDK header file <em>trulyhandsfree.h</em> contains a complete list of
API definitions and exported functions. Include this header file in
your application source code to access SDK API functions.</p>

<p>The header <em>sensorytypes.h</em> is included by code generated by
  the <a href="DumpRaw.html">DumpRaw</a> utility for use with
  <a href="static.html">static data</a>.
</p>

<!---
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Only a subset of the API functions may be available,
depending on which SDK library you choose to link with.</p>

<h3 ID="sdklib">Dynamical Library Files "TrulyHandsfree SDK\&lt;platform&gt\Bin":</h3>
When supported by the platform, the SDK API is packaged as a set of
platform-specific dynamic code libraries. The location of these libraries will depend on the platform. For example, dll's reside in the "bin" directory on ix86-win whereas shared-object files (.so) reside in the "lib" directory on ix86-linux.

Each dynamic library contains a different
subset of API functions so you can select the one appropriate for your
needs, as follows:
<ul>
 <li> <b>thf:</b> contains ALL available API functions (for both
 building and running a recognizer); Requires a file system.
 <li> <b>thfNoFS:</b> same as thf, minus functions that
 involve reading or writing to file.
 <li> <b>thfRecog:</b> contains API functions for running a recognizer
 only; Requires a file system.
 <li> <b>thfRecogNoFS:</b> same as thfRecog, minus functions that
 involve reading or writing to file.
</ul>

Accordingly, the following compile flags are used to determine which subset of API commands are available:  <b>THF_RECOG</b>, <b>THF_ALL</b>, <b>THF_RECOG_NOFS</b> and <b>THF_ALL_NOFS</b>.

<p>Additionally, debug libraries are provided, if needed. In general,
most Windows and WinCE platforms require debug libraries (when
debugging). However, we by-pass their need on ix86-win by using the
thfStubs mechanism (see Readme file).  The debug libraries have a
"Dbg" suffix (e.g., <b>thfDbg.dll</b> and <b>thfDbg.lib</b>). If
you intend to create a debug build of your application, be sure to use
the corresponding SDK debug dll and library, if available. </p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> Make sure you use the library for the appropriate platform.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Library filenames may vary slightly depending on
  platform. For instance, ix86-linux library filenames include the
  prefix "lib" (i.e., "thf" becomes "libthf.a").</p>
-->

<h3 ID="sdklib">Library Files "TrulyHandsfree SDK\&lt;platform&gt;\lib":</h3>
<!--
<p>For platforms providing dynamic code library support, a set of import
libraries are provided for compile-time linking. On other platforms,
the SDK is delivered as a set of static libraries with the same
subsets of API functions as described above. Debug libraries are
provided for some platforms (denoted by the "Dbg" suffix), if needed.
</p>
-->

<p>The SDK is delivered as a static library. Several build variants
  are possible, each of which contains a different subset of API
  functions so you can select the one appropriate for your needs, as follows:
<ul>
 <li> <b>thf:</b> contains ALL available API functions (for both
 building and running a recognizer); Requires a file system.
 <li> <b>thfNoFS:</b> same as thf, minus functions that
 involve reading or writing to file.
 <li> <b>thfRecog:</b> contains API functions for running a recognizer
 only; Requires a file system.
 <li> <b>thfRecogNoFS:</b> same as thfRecog, minus functions that
 involve reading or writing to file.
</ul>
</p>

<!--
<p>Accordingly, the following compile flags are used to determine which subset of API commands are available:  <b>THF_RECOG</b>, <b>THF_ALL</b>, <b>THF_RECOG_NOFS</b> and <b>THF_ALL_NOFS</b>.</p>
-->

<p><em>NOTE:</em> The current SDK only ships with the thf library. Please contact Sensory if you are interested in one of the other build variants.
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Make sure you use the library for the appropriate
  platform.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Library filenames may vary slightly depending on
  platform. For instance, ix86-linux library filenames include the
  prefix "lib" (i.e., "thf" becomes "libthf.a").</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> On some platforms (Android, for example) CPU-specific
  variants are included, for example <b>libthf_armeabi-v7a.a</b>
  or <b>libthf_mips.a</b>.
