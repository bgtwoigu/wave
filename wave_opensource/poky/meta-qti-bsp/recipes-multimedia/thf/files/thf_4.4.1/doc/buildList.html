<h2>Defining a Vocabulary Using a Phrase List (Easy)</h2>

A phrase list specification is simply an enumerated list of all the
phrases that make up the vocabulary. The following steps are involved
in creating a search object from a phrase list specification:

<ol>
<li>Define a list of words or phrases to be recognized.<br>
<li>Optionally define pronunciations for each phrase (see <a
href="pronuns.html">How to generate pronunciations</a>). <em>NOTE</em>:
The order of the pronunciation list must correspond with the order of
the phrase list. If no pronunciations are provided, they will be
generated internally. For optimal recognition performance, it's
recommended you provide them explicitly so you can verify accuracy and
possibly even tune them for your task. A tool, <a
href="CreatePronun.html">CreatePronun</a>, is provided that, given a
phrase list, generates an ordered list of pronunciations, which can
then be edited before inclusion in your code.  <li>Using the phrase
list and pronunciations (optional), compile the vocabulary
specification to create a search object by calling <a
href="thfSearchCreateFromList.html">thfSearchCreateFromList</a>. This
search object contains a binary representation of the vocabulary.
<li>Utilize the search object for recognition by calling <a
href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a> and/or save it to file
for later use by calling <a
href="thfSearchSaveToFile.html">thfSearchSaveToFile</a>.  <li>Destroy
the search object when no longer needed by calling <a
href="thfSearchDestroy.html">thfSearchDestroy</a>.  </ol>

<h3>Example Phrase List Specification</h3>
<pre>
const char *phrases[] = {
  "One",
  "Two",
  "Three",
  "This is a test",
  "Hello world",
  "*nota"
};
</pre>
