<h2>Improving Accuracy: Tuning Pronunciations</h2>

<p>The recognizer needs to know how to pronounce the words in the
recognition vocabulary. The key to good recognition is to accurately
model word pronunciations and their variations. In a
speaker-independent system, there may be many ways that different
speakers say the same words. The extent to which we can capture the
pronunciation variability of target users will impact recognition
accuracy. However, allowing for too much variability increases the
complexity of the recognizer, which results in lower accuracy. Only
those pronunciation alternates that are statistically significant should be added.
</p>

<p> A common source of pronunciations is a commercial dictionary. Some
dictionaries are better than others and some will list
<em>idealized</em> or <em>proper</em> pronunciations that are seldom
used by speakers of the language. E.g. the word <em>deleted</em> might
be listed with a pronunciation such as <em>/d I l i: th ^ d/</em>, when
it is usually pronounced <em>/d I l i: th_( & d/</em>. Notice the
<em>proper</em> t that is usually flapped and the final vowel which
changes from its <em>proper</em> pronouncement as a back vowel to a
under-emphasized <em>schwa</em>. Accuracy will improve when your
pronunciations are closer to that actually used by speakers. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you specify pronunciations explicitly when
defining a vocabulary. This allows you to modify and refine them
during the application development process. Pronunciation tuning is
best done empirically as either a batch process or using live
input. It would typically involve carefully reviewing cases where the
recognizer yields the incorrect result, paying attention to both the
pronunciation of the target phrase and actual phrase recognized and
modifying them as appropriate. In highly confusable cases, this may
involve actually modifying vocabulary itself. Note that the recognizer
can be configured to return the actual phonemes recognized, which can
be useful during the development and tuning process (see <a
href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a>). Through an iterative
process, it's usually possible to improve overall accuracy
significantly by addressing frequent erroneous cases. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Pronunciation tuning requires familiarity with both the
<a href="wordmodels.html">Syntax of Pronunciations</a> and with the Worldbet phonetic alphabet (see language-specific documentation for a list of Worldbet symbols supported by a particular language pack).</p>
