<h2>Generating Word Pronunciations (Easy)</h2>

Pronunciations specifications tell the recognizer how a particular
word or phrase will be pronounced. It's very important that this
specification captures how the word will be <em>actually</em> spoken in
practice as opposed to the ideal dictionary pronunciation. This
usually entails taking into account dialect variations and contextual
effects to incorporate several pronunciations variations.

There are several ways to arrive at a pronunciation specification:
<ul>
<li>Allow the system generate pronunciations internally, where appropriate (<em>easy</em>);
<li>Use a pronunciation model or the <a
href="CreatePronun.html">CreatePronun</a> tool, to automatically
generate them (<em>easy</em>);
<li>Generate them automatically and then modify/tune them by hand (<em>hard</em>);
<li>Write them entirely by hand  (<em>hard</em>);
</ul>

<h3>Generating Pronunciations Automatically</h3>
Pronunciations can be generated automatically using a language-specific pronunciation model, using the following the steps:

<ol>
 <li>Load a language-specific pronunciation model from file by calling <a href="thfPronunCreateFromFile.html">thfPronunCreateFromFile</a>. This creates a pronunciation object. Pronunciation model files are provided for supported languages.
 <li>Generate a pronunciations for each word or phrase by calling <a href="thfPronunCompute.html">thfPronunCompute</a>.
 <li>Destroy the pronunciation object when no longer needed by calling <a href="thfPronunDestroy.html">thfPronunDestroy</a>.
</ol>
This process has been automated for you in the <a
href="CreatePronun.html">CreatePronun</a> tool.

<h3>NOTE</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Pronunciations generated by <a href="thfPronunCompute.html">thfPronunCompute</a> and <a
href="CreatePronun.html">CreatePronun</a> represent 'base' pronunciations. Internally, phonology rules are applied to this base pronunciation when creating the search object using <a href="thfSearchCreateFromList.html">thfSearchCreateFromList</a> or <a href="thfSearchCreateFromGrammar.html">thfSearchCreateFromGrammar</a>. The phonology rules account for common pronunciation variations that result from contextual effects and regional dialects.
 <li>See <a href="wordmodels.html">Syntax of Pronunciations</a> for an understanding of how to write or modify pronunciations by hand.
 <li>It may be desirable to tune the generated pronunciations by hand for optimal performance.
 <li>If you are using a task-specific acoustic model (i.e., one
 trained for a specific vocabulary, such as <em>digits</em>) it may not be
 possible to use a pronunciation model to generate
 pronunciations. Task-specific acoustic models usually only support a subset of
 the phonemes produced by this automatic procedure. Refer to the
 <em>.txt</em> file accompanying the particular acoustic model file for a
 list of phonemes supported by that net.</p>
</ul>
