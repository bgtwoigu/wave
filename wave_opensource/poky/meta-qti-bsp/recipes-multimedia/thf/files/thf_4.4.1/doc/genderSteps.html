<h2>How to Perform Gender Identification</h2>
Gender identification is similar to speaker identification, except that the only two identities are 'female' and 'male', and enrollment and training a speaker is not required.

<h3>Step 1: Read in a Gender Model</h3>
<p>
An existing gender model is read from file into the recognizer object using <a href="thfSpeakerReadGenderModel.html">thfSpeakerReadGenderModel</a>.
Gender models are currently specific to a target phrase.
Please contact Sensory for development of a phrase-specific gender model.
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Perform Gender Identification</h3>
<p>
Gender identification is performed after a call to <a href="thfRecogResult.html">thfRecogResult</a> returns a value indicating that the target phrase has been recognized.
Identification is done by calling <a href="thfSpeakerGender.html">thfSpeakerGender</a>, which returns a gender score between 0.0 and 1.0.  A value less than 0.5 indicates a male speaker, and a value greater than or equal to 0.5 indicates a female speaker.
