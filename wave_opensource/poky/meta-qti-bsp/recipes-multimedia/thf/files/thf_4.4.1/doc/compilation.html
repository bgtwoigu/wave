<h2>Developing an Application Using the SDK</h2>

<p>Sensory's <i>TrulyHandsfree</i> SDK is written entirely in C. It can be
readily integrated into applications written in C, C++, C#, Tcl/Tk and Visual
Basic, amongst other languages.</p>

<p>It is assumed that you have a suitable compiler and, if available,
integrated development environment (IDE) correctly installed, such as
<em>Microsoft Visual Studio</em>, and that
you are familiar with how to program using the IDE or underlying
compiler. Most IDEs ship with sample code which you should be
comfortable with before attempting to use this SDK.</p>

<p>Next, make sure you familiarize yourself with the set of examples provided as part of this SDK (see <a href="samples.html">Sample Code</a>).
</p>

<p>Now you're ready to begin developing with applying the SDK. To integrate SDK API functions into your C/C++ application:
<ol>
<li>Include the <em>trulyhandsfree.h</em> SDK header file in your application.
<li>Use SDK API functions in your application.
<li>Link to the appropriate SDK static or dynamic code library.
</ol>

<b>NOTE:</b> Libraries are platform specific and contain different subsets of API functions, so be sure to link with the appropriate one.
