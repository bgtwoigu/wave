<h2>Syntax of Grammar Specification</h2>


A grammar specification is a set of rules that describe the sequence of words that make up the recognition vocabulary. The rules typically employ variables to represent sub-sequences of words.

The following syntactic conventions are used to specify grammars:
<ul>
<li>A grammar is a series of rules representing variable definitions, where the final rule represents the entire grammar.
<li>A rule is of the form: <pre>X = a b ... c;</pre> where X is the
defined variable. Variable references must include the $ prefix (e.g., $X).
<li>Each rule must terminate with a semicolon.
<li>Variables must be defined before they can be referenced.
<li>() Parentheses enclose items that are grouped together.
<li>[] Square brackets enclose optional items.
<li>&lt;&gt; Angle brackets denote one or more repetitions.
<li>{} Curly braces denote zero or more repetitions (same as "[&lt; &gt;]").
<li>| A pipe symbol separates alternative items.
<li>%% A double percent suffix suppresses the word from being returned in the recognition result.
<li>% A single percent sign conjoining two words forces the first word
to be substituted for the second word in the recognition result (E.g.,
<em>one%1</em> would recognize <em>one</em> but return <em>1</em>).
</ul>

<p>The last two conventions are used to format the text returned by
the recognition, and thus easing parsing in your application.
</p>

<p>Typically the input utterance is a word or phrase that is framed by
silence. Therefore, it is usual to include silence at the beginning
and the end of a grammar.</p>

<h3>Simple Grammar Specification:</h3>

The grammar comprises of a hierarchical set of phrase definitions, as follows:
<ul><pre>
  size       = small | medium | large;
  topping    = vegetarian | pepperoni | cheese;
  pizzaorder = *sil%% ($size | $topping) [*sil%%] pizza *sil%%;
</pre></ul>

<p>This grammar will allow 6 phrases, all ending in the word
<em>pizza</em>, and starting with <em>small</em>, <em>medium</em>,
<em>large</em>, <em>vegetarian</em>, <em>pepperoni</em> or
<em>cheese</em>. Notice that the silence will not return
anything in the result string if it matches because of the %% symbol. </p>
