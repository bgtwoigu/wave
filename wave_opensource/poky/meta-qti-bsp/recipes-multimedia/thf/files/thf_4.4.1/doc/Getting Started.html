<h1>Overview of the Recognizer</h1>

This section will guide you through the process of using the SDK to
build and run a speech recognizer.

<p>
Conceptually, a speech recognizer is simply an algorithm that takes
digitized audio as input and produces a text representation of the
recognized words as output. In practice, there are a number of
assumptions that are typically made to achieve this, such as what
language we're dealing with and what's the set of possible words or
phrases we're expected to recognize. The expected sequence of words is
known as the <em>recognition task</em> and consists of a grammar
specification and a list of words and their pronunciations.
</p>

<p>
Sensory's <i>TrulyHandsfree</i> recognition engine is made up of two parts:
<ul>
<li><b>Acoustic module</b>: This performs acoustic processing of the
audio input, including speech detection, signal processing, feature
extraction and phoneme probability estimation. It requires an acoustic
model in the form of a neural network datafile that must be loaded
during initialization. This datafile determines the language-specific
and speaker-independent characteristics of the recognizer. The
(hidden) data structure representing the acoustic module is referred
to as the <b><em>recog object</em></b>.

<li><b>Search module</b>: This processes the phoneme probability
estimates with respect to the vocabulary specification to determine
the highest scoring word sequence. It requires a pre-compiled grammar
and vocabulary specification that identifies the allowable word and
pronunciations sequences. The compilation can occur off-line or just
in time (online). The (hidden) data structure representing the search
module is referred to as the <b><em>search object</em></b>.  </ul>
</p>
<p>The recognition process is broken down into the following tasks:

<li><a href="building.html">How to define the recognition task</a>
<li><a href="process.html">How to build and run the recognizer</a>
