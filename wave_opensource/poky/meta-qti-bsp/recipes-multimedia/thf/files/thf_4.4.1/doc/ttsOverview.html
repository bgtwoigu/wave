<h1>Overview of Text-to-Speech Synthesis</h1>
<p>
Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) provides a way to generate audio from text. The language, task and voice are defined in a voice database which can be either read from file or from static data. Certain voice characteristics are also configurable, such as pitch and speech rate.</p>

<p>The TTS technology has a very small footprint and is designed specifically for short phrases such as Caller ID (e.g., first and last name). Each voice database has a specific task designation that it is intended to be used for.</p>

<p>Contact Sensory for details of voice database availability.</p>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to generate TTS audio :-

 <ul>
   <li><a href="TtsFull.html">Full synthesis</a>: generates a single block of audio buffer for the entire input text. This is the simplest approach.
   <li><a href="TtsPipelined.html">Pipelined synthesis</a>: generates a series of smaller audio blocks. This approach is a little more involved but gives greater control; It uses less memory and allows for audio playback to begin before synthesis is complete.
 </ul>
