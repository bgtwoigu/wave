<h2>How to Detect Speech</h2>

<p>The recognizer can be configured to use an internal speech detector
as a front end to the recognition process (see <a
href="thfRecogCreateFromFile.html">thfRecogCreateFromFile</a>). As the
name suggests, the purpose of a speech detector is to distinguish
speech from non-speech events. The intent is for it to act as a form
of audio filter such that we only perform speech recognition on the
speech regions. Not only does this reduce processing requirements (the
recognizer being more computationally <em>expensive</em> than the speech
detector), it can also improve recognition accuracy and reduce false
alarms. </p>

<p>More specifically, blocks of audio are fed through the speech detector.
Each block is identified as either speech or non-speech. Typically, non-speech
audio blocks are discarded until speech activity is detected. Subsequently
contiguous speech blocks are passed onto the recognizer, until the end of
utterance is detected. The end of utterance is determined by observing
sufficient silence following a speech region.</p>

<p>Several speech detector parameters that can be queried and
  configured
  using <a href="thfRecogConfigGet.html">thfRecogConfigGet</a>
  and  <a href="thfRecogConfigSet.html">thfRecogConfigSet</a>.
