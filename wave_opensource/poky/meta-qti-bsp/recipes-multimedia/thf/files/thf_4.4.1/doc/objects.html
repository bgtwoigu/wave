<h2>Data Structures</h2>
The following data structures are used to maintain the state of the
recognition engine. These are <em>internal</em> data structures whose

functions require this object as a parameter. You should begin your SDK
utilization by creating this object and end your SDK utilization by
destroying this object.

<td>ADAPT_SAVE_ENROLLMENT_AUDIO</td>
<td>This field specified whether or not the enrollment audio should
be saved in the
<a href='#thfAdaptUserInfo_t'>thfAdaptEnrollInfo_t</a> structure.
A value of 0 specifies that the original enrollment audio will not be stored
anywhere in the Fluent codebase after returning from a call to

A value of 1 specifies that the enrollment audio will be kept in memory and
copied into the  <a href='#thfAdaptUserInfo_t'>thfAdaptEnrollInfo_t</a>

The application may use fewer or more enrollments than the recommended
number, but performance may then be different from expected results.
In particular, with more enrollments the False Reject rate tends to decrease,

are recommended for this task.  An "enrollment with context" is the trigger
phrase spoken with an immediately-following context phrase.

This additional step is usually not necessary, as speech
detection will have been used to collect the enrollment
recordings.</td>

<td>ADAPT_CONTEXT_POSTPROCESS</td>
<td>This field specifies whether post processing of UDT enrollments should
be performed when one or more enrollments have context.  A value of
1 indicates that UDT post processing will be performed; 0 indicates it won't
be.  Post processing can improve overall performance, in particular the
enrollment quality checks, but at the cost of additional time during
<a href="thfAdaptEnrollmentCheck.html">thfAdaptEnrollmentCheck</a>.  This
