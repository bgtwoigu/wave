<h2>Getting the Recognition Result</h2>

<p>Use <a href="thfRecogResult.html">thfRecogResult</a> to get the
recognition result. It returns the recognized word or phrase and a
confidence score. The confidence score reflects how well the input
speech matched the underlying grammar and pronunciation
model. Typically, a score >=1.0 is regarded as a good result and <1.0
as a poor result. The actual confidence score calculation is dependent
on the <a href="params.html">Garbage</a> parameter.</p>

<p>If your grammar is set up to detect <a
href="nota.html">out-of-vocabulary</a> input, you can reject the
utterance if the highest scoring result is <em>*nota</em>.</p>

<p>Call <a href="thfRecogResult.html">thfRecogResult</a> multiple times in
order to retrieve the top N results, referred to as
<a href="nbest.html">N-best</a>.
The N-best results may include duplicate phrases that differ with respect to
their scores and alignment.
When there are no
(more) recognition results available, it will return NULL and a score
of 0.0.</p>

<p>The Beam and Pruning parameters (see <a
href="params.html">Parameters</a>) affect how many results are
available.
</p>

<p>The start and end times of the speech identified by the speech
detector can be obtained by calling <a
href="thfRecogGetSpeechRange.html">thfRecogGetSpeechRange</a>. Also,
use <a href="thfRecogGetClipping.html">thfRecogGetClipping</a> to
determine whether the audio input was clipped (i.e., too loud).</p>
