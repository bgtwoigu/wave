<h1>Overview of Enrolled Triggers, Speaker Verification, Speaker ID, and Gender ID</h1>
<p>
An enrolled trigger is a trigger (either user-defined or specified in advance)
that is adapted to a user's voice.  The adaptation requires several recordings
of the user saying the trigger.  These recordings are collected during an
enrollment phrase.  After adaptation, the trigger will respond better to the
enrolled user's voice than other users.  Enrolled triggers have the advantage
of lower false reject errors and lower false accept errors than
speaker-independent triggers.
<p>
Speaker Verification (SV) and Speaker ID (SID) provide text-dependent
voice security.
These techniques authenticate a user's claimed identity based on a spoken
password or phrase.
This differs from text-independent speaker identification, where the goal
is to identify a speaker based on unknown or free-form speech.
Sensory's text-dependent speaker verification and speaker ID are similar
to phrase-spotting speech recognition, a method of speech recognition
that recognizes a single pre-defined target phrase;
however, SV and SID attempt to detect individual differences in the way a
word is spoken, making it more sensitive to a particular person's voice.
As with an enrolled trigger, SV and SID adaptation requires multiple enrollments
of a target phase and training of one or more user-specific models. It also
requires subsequent verification against the set of trained models.
Usually, the collection of enrollments and adaptation steps are the same
for both creating an enrolled trigger and for speaker verification.
<p>
NOTE: For best performance, the enrollment recordings should be obtained in an
environment that is quiet and has minimal room reverberation.

<p>
<a href="genderSteps.html">Gender Identification</a> (gender ID) provides an indication as to whether the user of an application is male or female.  While this currently uses a text-dependent model, no enrollment or training is required.
