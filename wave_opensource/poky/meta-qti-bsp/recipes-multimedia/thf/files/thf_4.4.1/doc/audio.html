<h2>Audio Support</h2>

<p>You should consider using a separate thread for capturing audio and for performing
pipelined recognition (see <a href="feed.html">How to
Recognize</a>). This allows you to utilize operating system scheduling
to ensure adequate cycles for the capturing thread so that you don't
miss any audio samples, while utilizing any available cycles to finish
recognition as soon as the end of the utterance is detected. Depending
on your needs, audio recording and playback can become complicated
especially if you require asynchronous control.  Refer to the <a href="samples.html">RecogPipe</a> Sample for an example of how to do pipelined recognition using your own audio interface.</p>
</p>

<p>In general, the TrulyHandsfree SDK requires mono 16-bit linear PCM audio
format for input and output. The required sample rate depends on
which acoustic model is used by the recognizer, which you must specify
when you create the recognizer (see <a href="create.html">Create a
recognizer</a>). Some conversion to and from this format may be
required by your application, such as converting from mu-law to linear
PCM, or converting the sample rate.

<p>
Audio-related API functions include:
<ul>
<li><a href="thfWaveFromFile.html">thfWaveFromFile</a>: reads a RIFF
(sometimes referred to as Windows audio format or <em>.wav</em>) file
into memory.
<li><a href="thfWaveSaveToFile.html">thfWaveSaveToFile</a>: saves audio
to a RIFF file.
<li><a href="thfRecogGetSampleRate.html">thfRecogGetSampleRate</a>:
reports the sample rate of recognizer.
<li><a href="thfRecogSampleConvert.html">thfRecogSampleConvert</a>:
converts audio sample rate to match the recognizer.
</ul>
