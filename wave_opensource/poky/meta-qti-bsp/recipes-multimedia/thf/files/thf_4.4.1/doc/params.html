<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Recognizer Parameters</h3>
The following recognition parameters (controlling the internal speech
detector) can be both queried and set using <a
href="thfRecogConfigSet.html">thfRecogConfigSet</a>:
<ul>

<li ID="lsilence"><b>Lsilence</b> : Amount of leading or pre-speech
silence (milliseconds) allowed before the speech detector times
out. Default is 5000.0ms. The practical range is 40.0 to 60000.0. If
it's too short, it will tend to time out before seeing speech. If it's
too long, you risk long delays if speech fails to trigger the
detector.

<li ID="tsilence"><b>Tsilence</b> : Amount of trailing or post-speech
silence (milliseconds) required before the speech detector decides it
has found the end of speech. Default is 750.0ms. The practical range
is 40.0 to 2000.0. If tsilence is too short it will tend to return end
of utterance in the middle of multi-word phrases. If it's too long
then it forces a long delay after speaking which can delay the
recognition result.

<li ID="maxrecord"><b>MaxRecord</b> : Maximum record time
(milliseconds). If the end of speech is not encountered, it will
time-out after this duration. Default is 10000.0ms. The practical
range is from 1000.0 to 60000.0. If it's too short the speech may be
truncated. If it's too long then you risk long delays if the
background level is confused with speech and triggers the speech
detector.

<li ID="backoff"><b>Backoff</b> : Back-off buffer size
(milliseconds). The speech detector adds this amount of speech to
the beginning of where speech activity was detected. Default is 500.0ms. The
practical range is from 50.0 to 1000.0. If it is too short, you may
miss the start of the speech, and initial recognition accuracy will be
poor.

<li ID="eSilenceT"><b>eSilenceT</b> : Energy threshold used to find the start of speech.
Represents the difference between the short term and long term energy averages.
Default is 0.4. Practical range is 0.0 to 2.0.

<li ID="eSpeechT"><b>eSpeechT</b> : Energy threshold used to detect the end of speech.
Represents the difference between the short term and long term energy averages.
Default is 0.2. Practical range is -2.0 to 2.0.

<li ID="shortTermMs"><b>shortTermMs</b> : Short term window size (in milliseconds)
over which to accumulate energy. The difference between short term and long term average
is used to identify speech/non-speech boundaries. Default is 300.0.
The practical range is 50.0 to 1000.0. If this value is too large then the
speech detector may find the start of speech too late.

<li ID="longTermMs"><b>longTermMs</b> : Long term window size (in milliseconds)
over which to accumulate energy. The difference between short term and long term energy
is used to identify speech/non-speech boundaries. Default is 3000.0. The practical
range is 500.0 to 10000.0. If this value is too short the speech detector may find
the end of speech too early. <b>NOTE: </b>longTermMs is reset to 2500.0 whenever
MaxRecord is set to 5000.0 or greater.

<li ID="minduration"><b>MinDuration</b> : Minimum duration for speech
(milliseconds). If the speech is too short it gets ignored. Default is
200.0ms. The practical range is 40.0 to 1000.0, depending on the
vocabulary.

<li ID="epqEnable"><b>epqEnable</b> : Whether or not to use EPQ technique on trigger
results.  If EPQ is enabled (via a non-zero value), and if the EPQ value
is less than the threshold (see <a href='params.html#epqMin'>epqMin</a>),
the result is discarded.  Default is 0.  Legal values are 0 or non-zero. See  <a
href="epq.html">EPQ Guidelines</a> for recommended usage.

<li ID="epqMin"><b>epqMin</b> : If EPQ is enabled and the EPQ value of a
recognized trigger result is less than this threshold, the result is discarded.
Default is -5.0.  Practical range is -20.0 to 20.0, or -1024.0 to disable. See  <a href="epq.html">EPQ Guidelines</a> for recommended usage.
<li ID="SVadjustMethod"><b>SVadjustMethod</b> : Set the method used for
        adjusting SV scores.  Currently only a single method is supported,
        with value 1.
<li ID="SVadjust1"><b>SVadjust1</b> : First parameter used in adjusting SV
        scores.  Larger values cause SVadjust2 to be applied more frequently.
        A value of -1024 or less disables this parameter.  The practical
        range is 0 to 50.
<li ID="SVadjust2"><b>SVadjust2</b> : Second parameter used in adjusting
        SV scores.  A non-zero value adjusts some percentage of the SV scores.
        A value of 0 disables this parameter.  The practical range is
        0 to 0.1.
<li ID="SVadjust3"><b>SVadjust3</b> : Third parameter used in adjusting
        SV scores.  Smaller values cause SVadjust4 to be applied more
        frequently.  A value of 1024 or greater disables this parameter.
        The practical range is 0 to 50.
<li ID="SVadjust4"><b>SVadjust4</b> : Fourth parameter used in adjusting
        SV scores.  A non-zero value adjusts some percentage of the SV scores.
        A value of 0 disables this parameter.  The practical range is
        0 to 0.1.
<li ID="paramAadjustMethod"><b>paramAadjustMethod</b> : Set the method
        used in adjusting paramA.
        Currently only a single method is supported, with value 1.
<li ID="paramAadjust1"><b>paramAadjust1</b> : First parameter used in
        adjusting paramA.  Larger values make it easier to spot phrases.
        A value of -4096 or less disables this parameter.  The practical range
      is -2000 to 0.
<li ID="paramAadjust2"><b>paramAadjust2</b> : Second parameter used in
        adjusting paramA.  Larger values cause paramAadjust4 to have more
        effect than paramAadjust3.  A value of -1024 or less disables this
        parameter.  The practical range is 0 to 50.
<li ID="paramAadjust3"><b>paramAadjust3</b> : Third parameter used in
        adjusting paramA.  Larger values decrease the chances of spotting.
        A value of 0 disables this parameter.  The practical range is 0 to 500.
<li ID="paramAadjust4"><b>paramAadjust4</b> : Fourth parameter used in
        adjusting paramA.  Larger values decrease the chances of spotting.
        A value of 0 disables this parameter.  The practical range is 0 to 500.
<li ID="useFeat"><b>useFeat</b> : For a given recognizer, this parameter
        indicates whether the large set of features is used (1) or not (0).
        When used in UDT or EFT enrollment, this parameter specifies whether or
        not the resulting recognizer will use the large set of features.
</ul>


<h3>Search Parameters</h3>
The following search parameters can be both queried and set using <a
href="thfSearchConfigSet.html">thfSearchConfigSet</a>:
<ul>
<li ID="garbage"><b>Garbage</b> : Used to compute the confidence score
associated with recognition results, which in turn is used to decide
whether it's a good or bad result. Default value 0.5. Range is from
0.0 to 1.0. Smaller values will result in more confidant scores.

<li ID="any"><b>Any</b> : Used to control the amount of <a
href="wordspot.html">word-spotting</a> during
recognition, if applicable. Default value is 0.5. Range is from 0.0 to 1.0. Smaller
values will result in less word-spotting. Caution: too much
word-spotting will cause increasing amounts of speech to be ignored,
leaving insufficient evidence to match the pronunciation
specifications. This parameter is probably best left alone by the
novice user.

<li ID="nota"><b>Nota</b> : Used to control <a href="nota.html">out-of-vocabulary</a> rejection behavior during recognition, if applicable. Default 0.5. Range is 0.0 to 1.0. Smaller values decrease the out-of-vocabulary rejection and larger values increase it.

<li ID="beam"><b>Beam</b> : Provides a means of managing the size of
the search during recognition. If the difference in accumulated score
(log probability) between the best path and the current path falls
below the beam threshold, then the current path is discarded. Larger
beam values imply more paths remain active. Default is 250.0. Range is
50.0 to 5000.0. Both pruning and beam thresholds are applied,
producing the fewest number of active paths.

<li ID="pruning"><b>Pruning</b> : Fraction of search paths kept active during
recognition. Default is 1.0. Range is 0.0 to 1.0. It is preferable to
adjust the beam parameter rather than the pruning parameter. Larger
pruning values imply more states remain active, resulting in a larger,
more accurate but slower search. Increasing the recognition speed is
best achieved by adjusting this parameter. Caution: if you prune too
much, you risk discarding the correct recognition result. The number
of results available for N-best will also depend on this
parameter.

<li ID="longpen"><b>Longpen</b> : Reserved parameter.
</ul>

<h3>Phrasespot Parameters</h3>
The following <a href="phrasespot.html">phrasespotting</a> parameters are used to define recognition behavior and configured using <a href="thfPhrasespotConfigSet.html">thfPhrasespotConfigSet</a>:
<ul>

<li ID="psbeam"><b>Beam</b> : Provides a means of managing the size of
the search during phrasespotting. Larger
beam values imply more paths remain active. Default is 250.0. Range is
50.0 to 1000.0.
<li ID="psabsbeam"><b>Absbeam</b> : Provides a secondary means of managing the size of
the search during phrasespotting. Typically this is set to be larger than or equal to the beam. Default is 250.0. Range is 50.0 to 1000.0.
<li ID="delay"><b>Delay</b> : Delays the final result (in milliseconds) allowing competing paths the opportunity to beat the current best score. This is most useful when there are multiple phrasespotting phrases of differing lengths. A value of 0 is a special early-stop condition causing the result to be returned immediately that any path scores above threshold. A value of PHRASESPOT_DELAY_ASAP (defined in trulyhandsfree.h) is a special condition that stops as soon as a probable result is found, taking into account similar sounding phrases and shared paths, thereby balancing speed and accuracy. Default is PHRASESPOT_DELAY_ASAP.
<li ID="paramA"><b>ParamA</b> : Primary parameter for controlling sensitivity. Typically '-1200' is a reasonable initial value. Working range is from 0 to -2000. Values closer to zero will result in more phrasespotting. The optimal value is usually determined by batch testing on adequate quantities of in-vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary data and balancing the ratio of false-accepts and false-rejects, as appropriate to the application.  NOTE: an offset can be applied to this parameter after the vocabulary has been built using <a href="thfPhrasespotConfigSet.html">thfPhrasespotConfigSet</a>.
<li ID="paramB"><b>ParamB</b> : Secondary parameter for controlling sensitivity. Typically '500' is a reasonable initial value. For easy tuning, it's best to leave this fixed and only adjust 'paramA'. Practical range is from 100 to 1000. Smaller values result in less phrasespotting.
<li ID="paramC"><b>ParamC</b> : Reserved parameter.
<li ID="paramD"><b>ParamD</b> : Reserved parameter; a typical value is 200.
<li ID="pslongpen"><b>Longpen</b> : Reserved parameter.
</ul>

<h3>Speaker Verification and Speaker ID Parameters</h3>
The following <a href="SVOverview.html">speaker verification and speaker ID</a> parameters are used to define the verification and ID behavior.  These parameters are configured using <a href="thfSpeakerConfigSet.html">thfSpeakerConfigSet</a>, <a href="thfSpeakerConfigSet.html">thfSpeakerConfigSet</a>, and/or <a href="thfSpeakerConfigGet.html">thfSpeakerConfigGet</a>:
<ul>
<li ID="wantNumRecordings"><b>wantNumRecordings</b> : The number of recordings that are desired for enrolling the specified speaker.  There is no default, but a typical value is 3.  The value must be at least 1.
<li ID="haveNumRecordings"><b>haveNumRecordings</b> : The number of recordings that a speaker has currently enrolled with.  This parameter cannot be set, but can be queried.
<li ID="doneAdaptation"><b>doneAdaptation</b> : Whether or not adaptation (or training) has been done on the specified speaker.  The value is 0 if it has not yet been successfully done, otherwise 1.  This parameter cannot be set, but can be queried.
<li ID="recogWithAdapted"><b>recogWithAdapted</b> : reserved.
<li ID="speedAccuracy"><b>speedAccuracy</b> : Specifies a speed/accuracy tradeoff.  The speed of adaptation can be decreased to cause a potential increase in speaker verification accuracy, and vice versa.  The speedAccuracy value is an integer of at least 1.  The decrease in adaptation speed is a linear function of this parameter, but the increase in verification accuracy is not easily predicted.
<li ID="sampPerCat"><b>sampPerCat</b> : Amount of data to use in adaptation for the specified speaker when using the low-level API, namely <a href="thfSpeakerAdapt.html">thfSpeakerAdapt</a>.
<li ID="triggerSampPerCat"><b>triggerSampPerCat</b> : The number of samples per category to use in adaptation for all speakers for whom there is enrollment data, using the recommended API, namely <a href='thfSpeakerEnroll.html'>thfSpeakerEnroll</a>.
<li ID="sampPerCatWithin"><b>sampPerCatWithin</b> : An additional learning parameter. Greater values make the speaker-adapted recognizer more discriminating, and may require adjustment of other parameter values.
<li ID="targetSNR"><b>targetSNR</b> : Target signal-to-noise ratio for enrollment recordings. To disable this feature, use a targetSNR of 1024.0.
<li ID="durMinFactor"><b>durMinFactor</b> : Factor to multiply minimum durations by. If this value is greater than durMaxFactor, then no duration modification is performed.
<li ID="durMaxFactor"><b>durMaxFactor</b> : Factor to multiply maximum durations by. If this value is less than durMinFactor, then no duration modification is performed.
<li ID="trainIterations"><b>trainIterations</b> :
Number of training iterations.  More iterations performs more training but
increases the adaptation time.  The practical range is 1 to 5.
Default value is 1.
<li ID="trainIterationsWithin"><b>trainIterationsWithin</b> :
Number of training iterations for the 'within' class.  More iterations
performs more training, but increases the adaptation time.  The practical
range is 1 to 5.
Default value is 1.
<li ID="learnRate"><b>learnRate</b> :
Learning rate.  The practical range is 0.01 to 1.00.
Default value is 0.1640625.
<li ID="learnRateWithin"><b>learnRateWithin</b> :
Learning rate for the 'within' class. The practical range is 0.01 to 1.00.
Default value is 0.1640625.
<li ID="dropoutWithin"><b>dropoutWithin</b> :
Amount of dropout to perform. The practical range is 0 to 0.5.
Default value is 0.
<li ID="adaptType"><b>adaptType</b> :
The type of adaptation to perform.  Type 0 performs faster than type 1.
Legal values are 0 and 1.
Default value is 0.
<li ID="dspSvThresh"><b>dspSvThresh</b> : When writing files for DSP-level speaker verification (e.g. using <a href="thfSaveEmbedded.html">thfSaveEmbedded</a>), the default speaker verification threshold is included.  Setting this parameter changes this default SV threshold.
