<h2>Overview of User-Defined Triggers (Deprecated API)</h2>
<p>
THIS SECTION HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY
<a href="UDTandEFT.html">How to Implement User-Defined Triggers or Enrolled Fixed Triggers (With or
Without Speaker Verification)</a>
<p>
A user-defined trigger (UDT) is a phrase-spotting trigger phrase that is specified by the user.
This trigger requires enrollment from the user.  This enrollment consists of obtaining several
recordings of the desired trigger from the user, and processing these recordings to end up with
a user-specific recognizer and search.
<em>All recordings used in enrollment should be the same trigger phrase. They should not contain
extraneous speech. The trigger phrase should not contain any between-word pauses.
</em>
The SDK can perform simple error-checking for these requirements
(see <a href="thfUdtCheckEnrollments.html">thfUdtCheckEnrollments</a>), but these error checks
are not foolproof.  If bad data is detected, new enrollment recordings must be supplied,
and so it is best to provide good data initially.
</p>
<p>
Once the user-specific recognizer and search are obtained, they can be used for phrase spotting
in the same way as other phrase spotting in the SDK.
</p>
<p>
The UDT enrollment and recognition process has been designed to allow for more than one user.
Different users can enroll with the same trigger phrase or different trigger phrases.  The
enrollment step processes all of the enrollment recordings from <em>all</em> users in a single block,
generating a single recognizer and search that is capable of spotting the trigger phrase(s)
from all users. (In other words, a new user cannot be added to an existing UDT (or removed
from an existing UDT) without re-processing all enrollment recordings from all users.)
</p>
<p>
When a UDT has been spotted during recognition, a score can be obtained that indicates the
likelihood that the word was spoken by the person who made the enrollment recordings.  This
speaker-verification score can be obtained without calling the
<a href="thfSpeakerVerify.html">thfSpeakerVerify</a> procedure.  When used in this way,
UDT can be referred to as a User-Defined Passphrase (UDP).
