<h2>Creating a Recognizer</h2>

In this section, we describe the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Create a <a href"objects.html">recog object</a>
<li>Create a <a href"objects.html">search object</a>
<li>Configure the recognizer
<li>Initialize the recognizer
</ol>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Recog Object</h3>
<p>The <em>recog object</em> is the main data structure of the
recognizer. Create it with <a
href="thfRecogCreateFromFile.html">thfRecogCreateFromFile</a> that
will return a unique handle to the object. It requires you to specify
an acoustic model file to load, the maximum audio buffer size, the
maximum backoff size and whether or not you want to use a <a
href="sdet.html">speech detector</a>. </p>

<p>A selection of speaker-independent acoustic models is provided in
the SDK's <em>TrulyHandsfree SDK\Data</em>
directory. These vary in size and purpose, including general purpose
and task-specific acoustic models. In
general, larger acoustic models are more accurate but require more
computation. Some are trained on 8kHz and others at 16kHz. Choose
the one that is
most appropriate for your task and hardware.</p>

<p>It is feasible to create and maintain multiple recog objects in
memory, if needed. Each object has a unique handle. In one application
one might have the need for a task-specific acoustic model such as
digit strings and a general purpose acoustic model for the generic
vocabularies. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a Search Object</h3>
<p>The <em>search object</em> specifies the recognition vocabulary and
was explained in  <a href="building.html">How to define the recognition
task</a> section. Additionally, you can load a pre-compiled search
object from file using <a
href="thfSearchCreateFromFile.html">thfSearchCreateFromFile</a>.<p>

<p>It is feasible to create and maintain multiple search objects in
memory, if needed. Each object has a unique handle. In a typical
dialogue one can switch between vocabularies by swapping in the
appropriate search object when needed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Configure the Recognizer</h3>

Many parameters influence recognition behavior, such as the size,
speed and accuracy of the recognizer. The recog and search objects are
created with default values that should be configured as needed. Use
<a href="thfRecogConfigSet.html">thfRecogConfigSet</a> and <a
href="thfSearchConfigSet.html">thfSearchConfigSet</a> to get and set
recog and search object parameters, respectively. See <a
href="params.html">Parameters</a> for a description of available
parameters and their defaults values.

<p>
In general, parameters can be configured at any time. However, some
parameter changes will require reallocation of buffers and on
platforms where memory reallocation can only occur at predictable
times, make sure to configure parameters prior to initializing the
recognizer.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Initialize the Recognizer</h3>
<p>The recognizer must be initialized with <a
href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a> before it can be used. This
associates the search object with the recognizer, amongst other
things. </p>

<p>Also, you can use <a href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a> to
change the vocabulary of an existing recognizer, simply by calling
 <a href="thfRecogInit.html">thfRecogInit</a> with the new search
 object. All internal data structures (i.e., recognizer, search, and
speech detector) are reset during this call.</p>

<em>NOTE:</em> The search object is acoustic model specific. Ensure the
recog object uses the same acoustic model file for building the search
and recognizing with the search.
